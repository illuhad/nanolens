{"name":"Nanolens","tagline":"A high performance, fully parallelized MPI application to calculate magnification patterns caused by gravitational microlensing","body":"#About\r\nNanolens is an application to calculate gravitational lensing effects (currently microlensing magnification patterns, but additional features are planned for the future). Its main goals are\r\n* Modern Codebase: nanolens is a modern, object-oriented application written in standard-compliant C++11.\r\n* Generality: Features are implemented in the most general (but still efficient) way possible to allow for easy reuse for different applications.\r\n* Performance: Fully parallel MPI implementation, Starting with nanolens 3: Optional additional support for GPU acceleration via CUDA, support for GPU clusters.\r\n* Powerful: nanolens is designed to be an extendible collection of different methods algorithms rather than an implementation of one specific method.\r\n* User-friendly, flexible configuration: The application is fully controlled via a xml-file. No changes to the code itself are required to alter the solved problem. Results are stored in easy-to-use formats, such as FITS images.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
